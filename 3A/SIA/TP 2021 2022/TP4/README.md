# 🚀 TP4: Welcome to the Real World  

TP4 is the **final Deep Learning lab**, designed as an **interview-style challenge** where students tackle a real-world problem using **Deep Learning models only**—no traditional ML techniques allowed. This is your chance to **think like a DL Engineer**, explore solutions independently, and justify every decision you make.  

---

## 🌟 Key Features  

- **Real-World Scenarios**: Work on a **practical, industry-relevant** problem.  
- **Independent Problem-Solving**: No starter code—define your own **approach, architecture, and dataset handling**.  
- **Deep Learning Only**: Use **PyTorch (Lightning included)** or **TensorFlow (JAX included)**.  

---

## 📂 Lab Structure  

⚠️ **You will be assigned one of the following tasks at the start of the session. No pre-selection allowed.**  

### **🔹 Signature Verification**  
Train a model to verify the authenticity of **handwritten signatures**.  

### **🔹 Anomaly Detection**  
Build a Deep Learning model to **detect anomalies** in the **MNIST dataset**.  

### **🔹 Google Map Calque View Reconstruction**  
Develop a model that converts **satellite images** into **Google Maps-style visuals**.  

### **🔹 Brain Tumor Detection**  
Train a model to **detect tumors in Brain MRI scans**.

## 🛠️ How to Approach the Lab  

1. **Understand the Problem**: Analyze the dataset and define your **strategy**.  
2. **Choose the Right Architecture**: Justify your model selection and **loss function**.  
3. **Train & Evaluate**: Optimize your model and critically analyze your results.  
4. **Document Your Process**: Explain your design choices and insights.  

💡 **Use Google and discuss with your peers—but make sure you understand what you're implementing.**  

---

## 🚀 Evaluation Criteria  

- **Understanding of the problem & dataset**  
- **Justification of architecture & loss function**  
- **Dataset design & preprocessing choices**  
- **Results analysis & interpretation**  

⚠️ **Unjustified results or design choices will be penalized.**  
⚠️ **Do not start any work before the lab session—tasks will be assigned at the beginning.**

## 📜 Final Notes  

🔹 **Save a copy of your work** to your personal Google Drive.  
🔹 **No predefined code will be provided—this is a free-form challenge.**  

Good luck! 🚀
