# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Hands-On: From Classification to Segmentation  

This tutorial is divided into two practical sessions, focusing on key **deep learning workflows**â€”from basic **classification** to **object detection & segmentation**.

## ðŸ“Œ Part 1: Neural Networks & PyTorch Basics  

ðŸ”¹ **Goal**:  
- Apply concepts from the **Deep Learning course** in a practical setting.  
- Understand the **differences between various network architectures**.  
- Train a **Neural Network in PyTorch**.  
- Learn the **basic workflow** of a Deep Learning engineer.  
- Explore **essential DL frameworks**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Structure**:  
1. **Warmup on PyTorch** (Fundamentals & Implementation)  
2. **Real Task** (Classification with a more complex dataset)

## ðŸŽ¯ Part 2: Object Detection & Segmentation  

ðŸ”¹ **Goal**:  
- Apply deep learning to **object detection and segmentation**.  
- Fine-tune a **Mask R-CNN model** for segmentation.  
- Understand the extension from **Faster R-CNN** (bounding boxes) to **Mask R-CNN** (pixel-level masks).  

ðŸ”¹ **Approach**:  
ðŸš€ Given the **limited 2-hour timeframe**, we will **fine-tune** the model instead of training from scratch.  

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ”¥
