## TP1

TP1 is an introduction to Deep Learning and the most used Deep Learning Frameworks

The labs is divided into two parts. You will create and train a model that performs Classification on two different Datasets :

* FashionMNIST
* CIFAR-10

The objective :
* Learn to use Pytorch and Pytorch Lightning
* Use Trainers
* Fine-Tune a Model

## TP : Introduction to Pytorch Lightning

In this lab, you will be asked to train a Deep Learning model that performs Classification.
