## 🔍 The Transformer Model  

Transformers are **attention-based architectures** widely used in NLP, finance, and time-series forecasting. The model consists of:  

- **Encoder**: Maps an input sequence \((x_1,…,x_n)\) into a latent representation \(z=(z_1,…,z_n)\).  
- **Decoder**: Generates an output sequence \((y_1,…,y_m)\), consuming previously generated symbols (auto-regressive).
