## üöÄ Why These Labs?

These labs were developed during my PhD to address the need for practical, application-focused learning materials in the SIA course. They are designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, empowering students to confidently tackle real-world AI challenges.


Happy learning, and enjoy the labs! üöÄ
