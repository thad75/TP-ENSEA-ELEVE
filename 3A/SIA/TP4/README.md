## TP4 : Welcome to the Real World

TP4 is the final lab as a Deep Learning Student. 
This lab is an interview style question. You will be given a Dataset and a Task to perform. You will be asked to give a solution for the given problem.
You must only use Deep Models (and no ML technics) as main algorithms. 

Don't forget to save a copy of your Notebook in your personnal Drive



**⚠️⚠️Multiple subjects are available but only one will be assigned to you⚠️⚠️**

**You are absolutely free of all your doings. No code will be given to you.**

You will be free to use either
* PyTorch by Facebook (Even Lightning)
* Tensorflow by Google (Even JAX)

The objective :
* Learn to work as a DL Engineer
* Google things
* Exploit your results
* Check if you really understood something in this DL class/lab.

You'll be given one Real Condition task. If you need some guiding:
* Discuss with your team members
* Google things and make sure you understand them
* And finally ask me.

## Signature Verification

In this lab, you will be asked to train a Deep Learning model to perform Signature Verification

## Anomaly Detection

In this lab, you will be asked to train a Deep Learning model to perform Anomaly Detection on the MNIST Dataset

## Recreate Google Map Calque view

In this lab, you will be asked to train a Deep Learning model to recreate the Google Map images from a satellite view.

## Spot Tumours in Brain MRIs

In this lab, you will be asked to train a Deep Learning model to spot tumours from Brain MRIs.



We will note you on the following things : 
* Your understanding of the subject and the dataset.
* The reasons you used a particular architecture.
* How you design your loss and your Dataset.
* The results you're getting and your analysis of them.

**⚠️⚠️ Any unjustified result or move will not be taken into consideration and penalized in your notation⚠️⚠️**

**⚠️⚠️Don't begin any notebook before your lab. We will assign you a lab at the beginning of the lab session. ⚠️⚠️**

Good Luck :)
