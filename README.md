# 🚀 Deep Learning Labs for Engineering Students

This repository is a comprehensive collection of hands-on labs and projects I and few PhD fellows developed during our PhD time to support ENSEA Engineering students in their Deep Learning course. With the initial class materials falling short of providing practical, application-focused learning, I stepped in to create these resources to ensure students could gain the skills and knowledge essential for success in AI and Deep Learning. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, these labs will help you build a strong foundation and confidently tackle real-world challenges.
