# ðŸŽµ Hands-On: Artist Recommendation & MovieLens Recommender  

This repository contains two mini-labs on **Recommendation Systems**:  

1. **Artist Recommendation** â€“ Compute similarity scores to recommend artists based on listener preferences.  
2. **MovieLens Recommender** â€“ Build a movie recommendation system using the **MovieLens dataset**.  

---  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals  
âœ… **Artist Recommendation**  
- Use similarity computation to rank artists by relevance to the listener's taste.  

âœ… **MovieLens Recommender**  
- **Get lost** and navigate through documentation.  
- Discover new frameworks and explore data.  
- Build and train a recommendation model in **PyTorch Lightning** (NCF-inspired).  

This lab is **intentionally sparse**â€”future engineers must **search for information** and experiment! ðŸš€
