# 🎨 Hands-On: Understanding Deep Learning through Style Transfer  

Deep Learning models often feel like **black boxes**, but in reality, we can dive inside and see what they learn! In this lab, we’ll explore **Style Transfer**, similar to **Snapchat’s comic filters**, to visually understand how deep learning works.

## 🎭 Objective of Style Transfer  

Ever wished to **paint like Van Gogh**? Put away your paintbrush and fire up your **GPU**! **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** allows us to create artistic images using deep learning.  

📜 This technique was first introduced in **Leon A. Gatys’ paper**:  
[A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)  

💡 **What You’ll Do:**  
- Implement **NST using PyTorch**  
- Blend the **content of one image** with the **style of another**  
- Create **AI-powered artwork** 🎨

## 🔥 What You’ll Do  
✅ See how a model **processes information**  
✅ Import and use a **pre-trained model**  
✅ **Code interactively** in Python

## 🧠 A Simple Neuron  

To start, we'll tackle a **basic task**:  
- Given an **input (0 or 1)**, train a model to **invert** it.  
- Example: Input **0**, output **1** (and vice versa).  

🚀 **What You’ll Need**:  
- A **Dataset**  
- A **Model**  
- A **Training & Testing Loop**  
- Some **Hyperparameters**
