# 🚀 Hands-On: Deep Learning with TensorFlow  

This repository contains two **TensorFlow** labs focused on **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  

---

## 📌 Lab 1: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with TensorFlow  
✅ Learn the **TensorFlow workflow**:  
- Initialize variables  
- Start sessions  
- Train algorithms  
- Implement a **fully connected neural network**  

📌 **Structure**:  
- Part 1: **Using TensorFlow**  
- Part 2: **Training a classification model**  

---

## 🖼️ Lab 2: CNNs for Image Classification  
✅ Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on the **CIFAR dataset** using the **Keras Sequential API**.  
✅ Build and train the model in just a few lines of code!
