    "Deep Learning is a branch of AI where you **teach a Model** a certain **task** using a **Dataset**. The model or a neural network is built by multiple consecutive **layers** of neuron-like units, remotely based on neurons in the human brain. Typically, many consecutive layers are used, that is why it is referred to as deep learning. In those layers, each neuron has several **parameters** (**weights**) that are updated during **training** by minimizing a **loss** (error) function, using **Stochastic Gradient Descent**. Besides the model parameters, to be found using a dataset, there are also **hyperparameters** that you have to tune by yourself, for example, how many layers used in your model, how many neurons per layer,.... The Model infers a prediction from an **input**. In fact, a Deep Neural Network can be seen as a complex function ${f}$ that maps the input data to a learned space from the Dataset. \n",
