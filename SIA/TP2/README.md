## TP2

TP1 is an introduction to Generative Models using Pytorch Lightning

The labs is divided into three parts. You will create and train a model that performs Classification, Creation and Colorization using PyTorch Lightning :


The objective :
* Learn to use Lightning
* Understand AutoEncoders
* Understand GANs
* Cry because of your model.


## TP0 : Introduction to Pytorch Lightning (Part 1)

In this lab, you will be asked to train a Deep Learning model that performs Classification on MNIST using Lightning.

## TP1 : AutoEncoder (Part 2)

In this lab, you will be asked to train an AutoEncoder model

## TP2 : Image Colorization

In this lab, you will be asked to train a cGAN that performs image colorization
