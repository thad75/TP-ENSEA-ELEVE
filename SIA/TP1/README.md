## TP1

TP1 is an introduction to Deep Learning and Deep Learning Frameworks

The labs is divided into two parts. You will create and train a model to perform Classification on two different Deep Learning Framework :

* PyTorch by Facebook
* Tensorflow by Google

The objective :
* Learn to use Tensorflow and Pytorch
* Define your training/testing loop
* Choose your loss
* Train your first(?) model ðŸ¥²


## TP1 : Pokemon Classification (Part 1)

In this lab, you will be asked to train a Deep Learning model to perform Binary Classification on Pikachu and Jigglypuff.


## TP1 : CIFAR10 Classification (Part 2)

In this lab, you will be asked to train a Deep Learning model to perform Multi class Classification on the CIFAR10 Dataset
